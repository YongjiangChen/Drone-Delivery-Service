# Drone-Delivery-Service
2022

a path-planning Java application for an imagined Lunch-Delivery Drone. 
I realised the flightpath planning for an airborne drone which would collect lunch items from nearby shops and deliver them to outdoor locations around the campus. 
The algorithm was optimised for the shortest flight path, and a few non-fly zones were considered. 
This project scored 81%.
